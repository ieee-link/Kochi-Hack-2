# Hack Kochi #2
The second edition of Hack Kochi, by IEEE Kochi Hub and IEEE LINK

In this hackathon you get to build a simple chat application that follows the [pub/sub methodology](https://aws.amazon.com/pub-sub-messaging/). You can use [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) or any other database of your liking.
The backend for the website should be preferably in [firebase functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions) or [node.js](https://nodejs.org) with JS(JavaScript). The application is supposed to process real-time requests, concurrently from atleast 500 users. 
The front-end should be a web app built with [Angular](https://angular.io) that support text and if possible images(**bonus points**) as input. Web design is not to be considered in judging stage, we'd love to see you build awesome apps, not UIs :)
